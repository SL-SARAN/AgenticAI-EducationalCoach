        "Concept Confusion\n\nThe student likely misunderstood that in Python, single quotes ('A') are used for defining strings and double or triple quotes (''', \"\"\"\", \u201c\"\u201c) are used to define multi-line comments or docstrings which can also contain executable code. The correct way to represent the function definition would use a pair of matching triple quotes:\n\n```python\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    '''Returns the product of x and y'''  # This is just an example comment using triple quotes for clarity; it's not necessary in actual code.\n    return x*y\n```\nThe incorrect single quote usage here suggests a confusion between defining strings ('A') and function definitions or multi-line comments/docstrings that use triple quotes as shown above, which falls under concept misunderstanding (Concept Confusion).": 1,
